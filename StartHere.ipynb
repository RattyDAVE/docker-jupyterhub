    "[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a relative newcomer from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started.html).  It's intended to be an improved version of Java, including [Null Safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) combines the functional/type-inference paradigm and the object-oriented paradigm, and is also meant to be an improved version of Java.  Scala is the native language of [Apache Spark](Spark.ipynb).\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the oldest and most popular languages for database access.\n",

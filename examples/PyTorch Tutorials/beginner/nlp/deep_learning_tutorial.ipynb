        "\nDeep Learning with PyTorch\n**************************\n\nDeep Learning Building Blocks: Affine maps, non-linearities and objectives\n==========================================================================\n\nDeep learning consists of composing linearities with non-linearities in\nclever ways. The introduction of non-linearities allows for powerful\nmodels. In this section, we will play with these core components, make\nup an objective function, and see how the model is trained.\n\n\nAffine Maps\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOne of the core workhorses of deep learning is the affine map, which is\na function $f(x)$ where\n\n\\begin{align}f(x) = Ax + b\\end{align}\n\nfor a matrix $A$ and vectors $x, b$. The parameters to be\nlearned here are $A$ and $b$. Often, $b$ is refered to\nas the *bias* term.\n\n\nPyTorch and most other deep learning frameworks do things a little\ndifferently than traditional linear algebra. It maps the rows of the\ninput instead of the columns. That is, the $i$'th row of the\noutput below is the mapping of the $i$'th row of the input under\n$A$, plus the bias term. Look at the example below.\n\n\n"

        "Non-Linearities\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFirst, note the following fact, which will explain why we need\nnon-linearities in the first place. Suppose we have two affine maps\n$f(x) = Ax + b$ and $g(x) = Cx + d$. What is\n$f(g(x))$?\n\n\\begin{align}f(g(x)) = A(Cx + d) + b = ACx + (Ad + b)\\end{align}\n\n$AC$ is a matrix and $Ad + b$ is a vector, so we see that\ncomposing affine maps gives you an affine map.\n\nFrom this, you can see that if you wanted your neural network to be long\nchains of affine compositions, that this adds no new power to your model\nthan just doing a single affine map.\n\nIf we introduce non-linearities in between the affine layers, this is no\nlonger the case, and we can build much more powerful models.\n\nThere are a few core non-linearities.\n$\\tanh(x), \\sigma(x), \\text{ReLU}(x)$ are the most common. You are\nprobably wondering: \"why these functions? I can think of plenty of other\nnon-linearities.\" The reason for this is that they have gradients that\nare easy to compute, and computing gradients is essential for learning.\nFor example\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))\\end{align}\n\nA quick note: although you may have learned some neural networks in your\nintro to AI class where $\\sigma(x)$ was the default non-linearity,\ntypically people shy away from it in practice. This is because the\ngradient *vanishes* very quickly as the absolute value of the argument\ngrows. Small gradients means it is hard to learn. Most people default to\ntanh or ReLU.\n\n\n"

        "Objective Functions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe objective function is the function that your network is being\ntrained to minimize (in which case it is often called a *loss function*\nor *cost function*). This proceeds by first choosing a training\ninstance, running it through your neural network, and then computing the\nloss of the output. The parameters of the model are then updated by\ntaking the derivative of the loss function. Intuitively, if your model\nis completely confident in its answer, and its answer is wrong, your\nloss will be high. If it is very confident in its answer, and its answer\nis correct, the loss will be low.\n\nThe idea behind minimizing the loss function on your training examples\nis that your network will hopefully generalize well and have small loss\non unseen examples in your dev set, test set, or in production. An\nexample loss function is the *negative log likelihood loss*, which is a\nvery common objective for multi-class classification. For supervised\nmulti-class classification, this means training the network to minimize\nthe negative log probability of the correct output (or equivalently,\nmaximize the log probability of the correct output).\n\n\n"

We saw earlier that Tensors know how to compute gradients\nwith respect to the things that were used to compute it. Well,\nsince our loss is an Tensor, we can compute gradients with\nrespect to all of the parameters used to compute it! Then we can perform\nstandard gradient updates. Let $\\theta$ be our parameters,\n$L(\\theta)$ the loss function, and $\\eta$ a positive\nlearning rate. Then:\n\n\\begin{align}\\theta^{(t+1)} = \\theta^{(t)} - \\eta \\nabla_\\theta L(\\theta)\\end{align}\n\nThere are a huge collection of algorithms and active research in\nattempting to do something more than just this vanilla gradient update.\nMany attempt to vary the learning rate based on what is happening at\ntrain time. You don't need to worry about what specifically these\nalgorithms are doing unless you are really interested. Torch provides\nmany in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely\ntransparent. Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more\ncomplicated algorithms. Trying different update algorithms and different\nparameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning\nrates) is important in optimizing your network's performance.
